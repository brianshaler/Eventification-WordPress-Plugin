**Eventification WordPress Plugin**

Eventification provides a simple but powerful API for retrieving events from the system. Head on over to [http://eventification.com/api](the API documentation page) to brush up on how to put together a request and what to expect in return.

This plugin relies on the JSON format option, and can retrieve past and future events around any topic, geographic area, or venue. If you organize a regular meetup group, you can easily pull in all upcoming events for your group. If you run a venue that hosts events, this plugin will happy create posts/pages for each of your upcoming events.

The goal of this plugin is to give event organizers, hosts, and bloggers the ability to automatically create pages on their own site promoting their events. All you have to do is make sure Eventification is up to date with your upcoming events.

Here's how it works:

* You provide the plugin with an API endpoint (e.g. "get/events?tag=technology")

* You tell it if you want to create posts or pages (posts can be noisy to your RSS readers, pages can affect themes)

* You can also set up a Page to have the plugin list all upcoming events

* You get to focus traffic & SEO on your own site

Again, refer to the [http://eventification.com/api](API documentation) to figure out how to build your URL.

If you have any questions or comments, track down Brian Shaler. Please be mindful that this plugin is just a baby, and it's going to take some time for it to grow up!
